# Investigation Complete: PDF-to-JSON Parsing Issues

## Quick Start

This investigation analyzed the Archivev5.zip file to identify issues with the PDF-to-JSON conversion script (`llm_text_to_modento.py`) that generates Modento-compliant JSON forms.

**Status**: ‚úÖ Investigation complete, recommendations provided, **no fixes implemented yet** (as requested)

## Key Findings at a Glance

### Critical Issues (Priority 1)
1. **Grid checkboxes** - Multi-column layouts concatenated instead of split
2. **Orphaned checkboxes** - Labels on next line not associated  
3. **Junk text** - Business addresses becoming form fields
4. **Follow-up fields** - "If yes, please explain" not creating secondary fields

### Important Issues (Priority 2)
5. **Line wrapping** - Multi-line questions not joined properly
6. **Consent checkboxes** - Merged with preceding fields incorrectly
7. **Conditions consolidation** - Multiple dropdowns instead of one
8. **Terms detection** - Long paragraphs should be terms fields

### Polish Issues (Priority 3)
9. **Section headers** - Not always detected correctly
10. **Junk tokens** - Various markers still appearing

## Example: Grid Checkbox Issue

**Current (WRONG)**:
```json
{
  "key": "aidshiv_positive_chest_pains_headaches",
  "title": "AIDS/HIV Positive [ ] Chest Pains [ ] Headaches",
  "control": {
    "options": [
      {"name": "AIDS/HIV Positive [ ] Chest Pains [ ] Headaches"}
    ]
  }
}
```

**Should Be (CORRECT)**:
```json
{
  "key": "medical_conditions",
  "title": "Do you have any of the following?",
  "control": {
    "options": [
      {"name": "AIDS/HIV Positive", "value": "aids_hiv_positive"},
      {"name": "Chest Pains", "value": "chest_pains"},
      {"name": "Headaches", "value": "headaches"}
    ],
    "multi": true
  }
}
```

## Code Areas to Modify

| Function | Lines | What to Fix |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `options_from_inline_line()` | 400-450 | Grid checkbox splitting |
| `parse_to_questions()` | 600-1000 | Orphaned checkboxes, follow-ups |
| `scrub_headers_footers()` | 250-300 | Enhanced junk filtering |
| `coalesce_soft_wraps()` | 300-350 | Better line joining |
| `is_heading()` | ~200 | Section detection |

---

## Fix Principles

All proposed fixes follow these principles:

‚úÖ **General pattern matching** - No hard-coding for specific forms  
‚úÖ **Heuristic-based** - Use layout, spacing, context clues  
‚úÖ **Backwards compatible** - Won't break existing forms  
‚úÖ **Incremental** - Can implement one at a time  
‚úÖ **Testable** - Verify against sample forms  

---

## Sample Forms Analyzed

From Archivev5.zip:
- ‚úÖ Chicago-Dental-Solutions_Form (PDF, TXT, JSON)
- ‚úÖ npf (PDF, TXT, JSON)  
- ‚úÖ npf1 (PDF, TXT, JSON)

All issues identified by comparing TXT inputs to JSON outputs and reviewing the PDF sources.

---

## Implementation Order (Recommended)

1. Fix 3 (junk filtering)
2. Fix 5 (line coalescing)
3. Fix 1 (grid checkboxes)
4. Fix 2 (orphaned checkboxes)
5. Fix 4 (follow-up fields)
6. Fix 7 (medical conditions)
7. Fix 6 (consent separation)
8. Fix 8 (terms detection)
9. Fixes 9 & 10 (polish)

Each fix is independent and can be done separately.
