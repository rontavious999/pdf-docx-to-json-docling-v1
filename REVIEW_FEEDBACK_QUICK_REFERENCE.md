# Review Feedback - Quick Reference Guide

## 🎯 Quick Overview

Repository review identified **5 edge cases** affecting **<5% of fields**. All have been translated into detailed, actionable next steps in `ACTIONABLE_ITEMS.md`.

## 📊 The 5 Edge Cases

| Issue | Current Impact | Priority | Steps | Status |
|-------|---------------|----------|-------|--------|
| Multi-sub-field labels not split | <2% of fields | 2.1 | 8 steps | 📋 Documented |
| Grid column headers not captured | <1% of fields | 2.2 | 8 steps | 📋 Documented |
| Inline checkboxes missed | <1% of fields | 2.3 | 9 steps | 📋 Documented |
| OCR requires manual flag | Usability issue | 1.1 | 10 steps | 📋 Documented |
| Visual layout dependency | <1% of fields | 2.4 | 7 steps | 📋 Documented |

## 🔍 Issue #1: Multi-Sub-Field Labels Not Split

**Problem**: `Phone: Mobile _____ Home _____ Work _____` → captured as 1 field instead of 3

**Solution Approach**:
- Detect repeated underscore/blank patterns
- Use generic keyword detection (Mobile, Home, Work, Cell, etc.)
- Analyze spacing between fields
- NO hardcoding of specific field names

**Implementation**: See Priority 2.1 (8 detailed steps)

## 📊 Issue #2: Checkbox Grid Column Headers

**Problem**: Headers like "Appearance / Function / Habits" not associated with options

**Solution Approach**:
- Detect header row patterns (slashes, pipes, spacing)
- Map checkbox positions to column headers
- Choose output strategy (requires stakeholder decision):
  - **Option A**: Prefix names ("Habits - Smoking")
  - **Option B**: Add metadata (`{"text": "Smoking", "category": "Habits"}`)
  - **Option C**: Nested groups (`{"Habits": ["Smoking", ...]`)

**Implementation**: See Priority 2.2 (8 detailed steps)

**⚠️ Stakeholder Decision Required**: Which output strategy (A, B, or C)?

## ☑️ Issue #3: Inline Checkbox Statements

**Problem**: `[ ] Yes, send me text alerts` → text captured but no separate field created

**Solution Approach**:
- Enhanced regex for mid-sentence checkboxes
- Extract Yes/No + continuation text
- Generate field with meaningful key
- Prevent false positives (don't split option lists)

**Implementation**: See Priority 2.3 (9 detailed steps)

## 🔍 Issue #4: OCR Auto-Detection

**Problem**: Users must manually use `--ocr` flag for scanned PDFs

**Solution Approach**:
- Detect when text extraction yields minimal content
- Automatically invoke OCR when text layer is insufficient
- Add heuristics: text density, character count, meaningful words
- Maintain manual override options

**Implementation**: See Priority 1.1 (10 detailed steps)

## 📐 Issue #5: Visual Layout-Dependent Fields

**Problem**: Fields relying purely on spatial arrangement (without labels) are difficult

**Solution Approach**:
- Primarily a **documentation item** (rare in practice)
- Document limitation and best practices
- Monitor for real instances
- Multi-field splitting (Issue #1) covers most cases
- Consider layout-aware parsing only if frequency increases

**Implementation**: See Priority 2.4 (7 detailed steps)

## 🎯 Core Principles (Must Follow)

All solutions must adhere to these principles:

✅ **NO form-specific hacks** - Only generic logic  
✅ **Configurable patterns** - Keywords and thresholds are parameters  
✅ **Heuristic-based** - Pattern detection, spacing analysis  
✅ **Well-tested** - Comprehensive test coverage  
✅ **Backward compatible** - Maintain >95% accuracy  

## 📈 Expected Impact

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Field Capture Accuracy | >95% | >98% | +3% |
| Edge Case Coverage | 95% | 98% | +3% |
| Multi-field Detection | Manual | Auto | ✅ |
| Grid Headers | Not captured | Captured | ✅ |
| Inline Checkboxes | Partial | Complete | ✅ |
| OCR Trigger | Manual | Auto | ✅ |

## 🚀 Recommended Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 days)
1. **Priority 2.4** - Document visual layout limitation (documentation only)
2. **Priority 1.1** - OCR auto-detection (improves usability)

### Phase 2: High Impact (1-2 weeks)
3. **Priority 2.1** - Multi-field splitting (highest field impact)
4. **Priority 2.3** - Inline checkbox detection (medium complexity)

### Phase 3: Nice to Have (2-3 weeks)
5. **Priority 2.2** - Grid column headers (requires stakeholder decision first)
