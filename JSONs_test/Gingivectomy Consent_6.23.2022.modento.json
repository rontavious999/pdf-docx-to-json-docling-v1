It is impossible to adequately clean teeth with deep gingival pockets- toothbrush bristles cannot reach more than 4mm down into the sulcus. Plaque left on our teeth will eventually harden, due to the minerals in our saliva, and become tartar (calculus). This calculus is a hard deposit that requires removal using sharp instruments. Brushing and flossing are no longer sufficient to clean teeth when calculus is present."
