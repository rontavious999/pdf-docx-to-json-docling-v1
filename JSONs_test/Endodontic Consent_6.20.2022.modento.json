      "html_text": "Root canal therapy (endodontic treatment) is a procedure that retains a tooth which would otherwise require extraction. Although root canal therapy has a high success rate, results cannot be guaranteed. Occasionally, a tooth that has undergone a root canal may require re-treatment, surgery, or even extraction. Following treatment, the tooth will discolor and become brittle and subject to fracture- therefore, a crown (sometimes including post and core) is necessary to restore the tooth. During endodontic treatment there is the possibility of instrument fracture within root canals, perforations, or tooth fracture depending on the extent of infection. There are times when a minor surgical procedure may be indicated, or when the tooth may not be amenable to endodontic treatment at all. Other treatment choices include no treatment or tooth extraction. Risks involved in treatment might include, but are not limited to:"

You should not operate a motor vehicle or any hazardous device while taking such medications. In addition, certain medications may cause allergic reactions, such as hives, or intestinal discomfort. If any of these problems occur, call immediately. It is the patient’s responsibility to report any changes in his/her medical history to the doctor."
