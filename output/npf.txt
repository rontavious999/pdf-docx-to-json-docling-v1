路   Patient Responsibilities: We are committed to providing you with the best possible care and helping you achieve your 
    optimum oral health. Toward these goals, we would like to explain your financial and scheduling responsibilities with 
    our practice. 

    Payment: Payment is due at the time services are rendered. Financial arrangements are discussed during the initial 
    visit and a financial agreement is completed in advance of performing any treatment with our practice. We accept the 
    following forms of payment: Cash (US currency only), certified check or money order, credit card (Visa, Mastercard, 
    Amex, Discover). Personal checks are also accepted from patients who have established a positive payment history with 
    the practice. Non-sufficient funds or returned checks may be grounds for declining future personal checks and an 
    alternative form of payment may be requested, upon the discretion of the doctor. 
路   Dental Benefit Plans: Your dental insurance benefit is a contract between you or your employer and the dental benefit 
    plan. Benefits and payments received are based on the terms of the contract negotiated between you or your employer 
    and the plan. We are happy to help our patients with dental benefit plans to understand and maximize their coverage. 
        Our practice DIS DIS NOT (check one) a contracted provider with your dental benefit plan. 
        If we are a contracted provider with your plan, you are responsible only for your portion of the approved fee as 
        determined by your plan. We are required to collect the patient's portion (deductible, co-insurance, co-pay, or any 
        amount not covered by the dental benefit plan) in full at time of service. If our estimate of your portion is less than 
        the amount determined by your plan, the amount billed to you will be adjusted to reflect this. 
        If we are not a contracted provider with your dental benefit plan, it is the patient's responsibility to verify with 
        the plan whether the plan allows patients to receive reimbursement for services from out-of-network providers. If 
        your plan allows reimbursement for services from out-of-network providers, our practice can file the claim with 
        your plan and receive reimbursement directly from the plan if you "assign benefits" to us. In this circumstance, you 
        are responsible and will be billed for any unpaid balance for services rendered upon receipt of payment from the 
        plan to our practice, even if that amount is different than our estimated patient portion of the bill. If you choose to 
        not "assign benefits" to our practice, you are responsible for filing claims and obtaining reimbursement directly from 
        your dental benefit plan and will be responsible for payment in full to our practice before or at the time of service. 
路   Scheduling of Appointments: We reserve the doctor and hygienist's time on the schedule for each patient procedure 
    and are diligent about being on-time. Because of this courtesy, when a patient cancels an appointment, it impacts the 
    overall quality of service we are able to provide. To maintain the utmost service and care, we do require 24 hour advance 
    notice to reschedule an appointment. With less than 24 hour notice, a cancellation fee of minimum $50 may be 
    charged or deposit to reserve the appointment time again, may be required. To serve all of our patients in a timely 
    manner, we may need to reschedule an appointment if a patient is ten minutes late or more arriving to our practice. To 
    reschedule an appointment due to late arrival, a fee of minimum $50 may be charged or deposit to reserve the 
    appointment time again, may be required. 
路   Authorizations: I understand that the information I have provided is correct to the best of my knowledge. I authorize 
    this dental team to perform any necessary dental services that I may need and have consented to during diagnosis and 
    treatment.         (initial) 
I have read the above and agree to the financial and scheduling terms.            (initial) 
I authorize the release of my personal information necessary to process my dental benefit claims, including health 
information, diagnosis, and records of any treatment or exam rendered. I hereby authorize payment of benefits 
directly to this dental office otherwise payable to me. [ ] YES [ ] NO Check One                 initial)
