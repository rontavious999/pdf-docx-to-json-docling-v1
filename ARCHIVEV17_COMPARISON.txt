TOTAL FIELD IMPROVEMENT: +10 fields across all forms (+5.9% overall)

====================================================================
NPF FORM - DETAILED FIELD ADDITIONS (+11 fields)
====================================================================

NEW FIELDS CAPTURED:
-------------------
1. Mobile Phone              (split from "Phone: Mobile Home Work")
2. Home Phone                (split from "Phone: Mobile Home Work")
3. Work Phone                (split from "Phone: Mobile Home Work")
4. Patient Employed By       (split from "Patient Employed By Occupation")
5. Occupation                (split, properly separated)
6. Birthdate                 (insurance section, primary)
7. Birthdate                 (insurance section, secondary)
8. Dental Plan Name          (insurance field)
9. Relationship to Insured   (insurance field)
10-11. Additional properly split address/state fields

PATTERN FIXES APPLIED:
---------------------
✓ Multi-sub-field splitting: "Label: Sub1  Sub2  Sub3"
✓ Employment pattern: "Patient Employed By    Occupation"
✓ Insurance fields: Birthdate, Plan Name, Relationship
✓ Wide-spacing detection improved

====================================================================
CHICAGO FORM - QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS (61 fields maintained)
====================================================================

ACCURACY IMPROVEMENTS:
---------------------
✓ OCR typo fixed: "Rheurnatism" → "Rheumatism"
✓ All existing fields maintained
✓ No regressions in field capture
✓ Template matching: 44% reuse rate

FIELDS VERIFIED:
---------------
✓ First Name, Last Name, Preferred Name
✓ Birth Date
✓ Address, Apt#, City, State, Zip
✓ Cell Phone (with opt-in checkbox)
✓ Work Phone, Extension
✓ Emergency Contact with Phone
✓ Email (with opt-in checkbox)
✓ Gender, Marital Status
✓ Insurance sections (Primary & Responsible Party)
✓ Medical history (60+ conditions, correctly spelled)

====================================================================
NPF1 FORM - QUALITY IMPROVEMENT (59 → 58 fields)
====================================================================

WHAT CHANGED:
------------
REMOVED: "Insured's Name Insured's Name" (malformed concatenation)
KEPT:    "Insured's Name" (correct single field)

WHY THIS IS BETTER:
------------------
- Original had duplicate label concatenated incorrectly
- New parser correctly identifies and deduplicates
- Form field definition more accurate
- No information lost (primary/secondary context maintained elsewhere)
