## Latest Implementations (Commit eb90e98)

### Fix 1.1: Enhanced Multi-Field Line Splitting ✅

**Problem**: Lines containing multiple short labels followed by underscores were not being split when those labels weren't in the KNOWN_FIELD_LABELS dictionary.

**Examples**:
```
Input:  "First____________________ MI_____ Last_______________________"
Output: 3 fields → "First____", "MI_____", "Last_____"

Input:  "City_________________________________________________ State_______ Zip__________"
Output: 3 fields → "City____", "State_____", "Zip____"

Input:  "Date__________ Time__________ Location__________"
Output: 3 fields → "Date____", "Time____", "Location____"
```

**Implementation**:
- Created `split_short_label_underscore_pattern()` function
- Pattern detection: `\b([A-Z][A-Za-z]{1,14})\s*_{3,}`
- Requires 2+ patterns on a single line to trigger splitting
- Each label must be 2-15 characters long
- Generic pattern matching without hardcoding specific field names

**Code Location**: `docling_text_to_modento/core.py`

**Integration**:
- Added as step 7 in `enhanced_split_multi_field_line()` function
- Runs after all existing splitting strategies as fallback
- Returns unsplit line if pattern doesn't match

**Test Results**:
```python
# Manual testing confirmed correct splitting
split_short_label_underscore_pattern("First____ MI____ Last____")
# Returns: ['First____', 'MI____', 'Last____']
```

### Fix 1.4: Enhanced Grid Column Detection ✅

**Problem**: Column detection in tightly-spaced grids could miss columns or incorrectly identify boundaries. Simple baseline matching wasn't robust enough for:
- Sparse grids (not all rows have all columns)
- Proportional font spacing variations
- Simple 2-column grids

**Solution**: Enhanced `detect_column_boundaries()` with statistical clustering approach.

**Improvements**:

1. **Clustering Algorithm**:
   - Collects all checkbox positions from multiple lines
   - Groups positions within ±3 characters into clusters
   - Computes median position for each cluster (more robust than mean)
   - Calculates support percentage (how many lines contribute to each cluster)

2. **Improved Support Threshold**:
   - Lowered from 60% to 50% for sparse grid detection
   - Better captures irregular layouts where not all rows have all columns

3. **2-Column Grid Support**:
   - Added fallback for simple 2-column grids
   - Accepts 2 columns if both have 70%+ support
   - Previously required minimum 3 columns

**Algorithm**:
```python
# Pseudocode
1. Collect all checkbox positions from N lines
2. Sort and cluster positions (±3 char tolerance)
3. For each cluster:
   - Compute median position
   - Calculate support (% of lines with checkbox near this position)
4. Filter clusters by support >= 50%
5. If >= 3 columns found, return them
6. If == 2 columns with >= 70% support each, return them
7. Otherwise return None
```

**Benefits**:
- More accurate column detection in dense grids
- Better handling of irregular/sparse layouts
- Statistical robustness with median positioning
- Support for simple 2-column grids

**Code Location**: `docling_text_to_modento/modules/grid_parser.py`

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Incremental Implementation**: Implementing fixes in batches (5 + 2) allowed for testing and validation
2. **Pattern Hierarchy**: New splitters added as fallbacks ensure no breaking changes
3. **Statistical Approach**: Clustering and median positioning more robust than simple matching
4. **Clear Documentation**: Each fix clearly documented with examples and rationale

### Challenges Addressed

1. **False Positives**: Added guards to prevent incorrect splitting (e.g., multi-field check in fill-in-blank)
2. **Pattern Overlap**: Careful ordering of detection strategies prevents conflicts
3. **Sparse Data**: Lowered thresholds for sparse grids without compromising accuracy
4. **Edge Cases**: Comprehensive pattern matching handles various input formats

### Best Practices Established

1. Test pattern functions in isolation before integration
2. Use statistical methods (median, clustering) for robustness
3. Document pattern intent with concrete examples
4. Add fallback strategies for graceful degradation
5. Maintain consistent code style and documentation
