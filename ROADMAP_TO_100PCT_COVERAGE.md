# Roadmap to 100% Field Capture Coverage

**Current Status:**
- Chicago Dental Solutions: 93 fields, 86.4% coverage (Gap: ~15 fields)
- NPF: 58 fields, 45.5% coverage (Gap: ~70 fields)
- NPF1: 132 fields, 33.3% coverage (Gap: ~130 fields)

**Note**: This document lists ALL potential improvements to reach 100% coverage, including those that **VIOLATE** the no-hardcoding requirement. Each item is clearly marked.

---

## Category 1: Generic Pattern Improvements (✅ COMPLIANT)

These improvements follow the no-hardcoding requirement and use only generic pattern detection.

### 1.1 Enhanced Multi-Field Line Splitting
**Impact**: Medium-High (5-10 fields per form)
**Complexity**: Medium
**Requirement Compliance**: ✅ COMPLIANT

**Description**: Improve detection and splitting of lines with multiple input fields.

**Current Issue**:
- "Patient Name: First______ MI____ Last______" captured as single field
- "Date of Birth____ Relationship____ Phone____" merged into one field
- "Phone: Mobile______ Home______ Work______" not always split properly

**Proposed Fix**:
1. Enhanced pattern detection for "Label1____ Label2____ Label3____" on single line
2. Smarter splitting based on:
   - Whitespace + underscore patterns
   - Known label keywords (First, Last, MI, Home, Work, etc.)
   - Multiple underscore groups with text labels between them

**Implementation**:
```python
# Detect pattern: "text___ text___ text___" on single line
# Split into separate fields for each text/underscore pair
# Generic detection without form-specific logic
```

**Files to Modify**: `core.py` - `enhanced_split_multi_field_line()`

---

### 1.2 Fill-in-Blank Pattern Enhancement
**Impact**: Low-Medium (3-5 fields per form)
**Complexity**: Low
**Requirement Compliance**: ✅ COMPLIANT

**Description**: Capture all fill-in-blank fields even without explicit labels.

**Current Issue**:
- Lines with "______" alone might be skipped if no clear label
- Continuation underscores not creating fields
- Some underscore fields absorbed into previous field

**Proposed Fix**:
1. Any line with 5+ consecutive underscores should create an input field
2. Use preceding text as label (within same line or previous line)
3. If no label found, use placeholder like "Text input field {n}"

**Implementation**:
```python
# Pattern: Detect "____{5,}" 
# Extract label from context (same line or prev line)
# Create input field with inferred label
```

**Files to Modify**: `core.py` - input field detection logic

---

### 1.3 Improved Text-Based Option Detection
**Impact**: Medium (5-8 fields per form)
**Complexity**: Medium
**Requirement Compliance**: ✅ COMPLIANT

**Description**: Better capture text-based multiple choice fields.

**Current Issue**:
- "Yes or No" text patterns sometimes not captured
- "M or F" / "Male or Female" patterns occasionally missed
- "Please Circle One: Single Married Divorced" not always detected

**Proposed Fix**:
1. Enhanced regex for text-based options: "Option1 or Option2"
2. Better detection of "Circle one:" / "Check one:" patterns
3. Capture space-separated option lists after trigger words

**Implementation**:
```python
# Patterns: "X or Y", "Circle One: X Y Z", "Check One: X Y Z"
# Parse options from text without relying on checkboxes
# Generic pattern matching for common option formats
```

**Files to Modify**: `core.py` - `detect_inline_text_options()`

---

### 1.4 Enhanced Grid Column Detection
**Impact**: Medium (5-10 fields per form)
**Complexity**: High
**Requirement Compliance**: ✅ COMPLIANT

**Description**: Improve detection of tightly-spaced checkbox columns in grids.

**Current Issue**:
- Dense multi-column grids might miss some checkbox options
- Column boundaries not always accurately detected
- Options with minimal spacing get merged

**Proposed Fix**:
1. More sophisticated column boundary detection using:
   - Character position analysis
   - Checkbox alignment patterns
   - Statistical spacing analysis across rows
2. Better handling of proportional font spacing

**Implementation**:
```python
# Enhanced column detection using checkbox positions
# Statistical analysis of spacing patterns
# Alignment-based column inference
```

**Files to Modify**: `modules/grid_parser.py` - `detect_column_boundaries()`

---

### 1.5 Relationship Field Detection
**Impact**: Low-Medium (2-4 fields per form)
**Complexity**: Low
**Requirement Compliance**: ✅ COMPLIANT

**Description**: Better capture relationship and emergency contact fields.

**Current Issue**:
- "Relationship to patient:" fields sometimes missed
- Emergency contact information not always captured
- Parent/guardian relationship fields inconsistent

**Proposed Fix**:
1. Add relationship patterns to known label detection
2. Enhanced emergency contact pattern matching
3. Better handling of "Self/Spouse/Parent/Other" option patterns

**Implementation**:
```python
# Add patterns: "Relationship", "Emergency Contact", "Guardian"
# Detect associated option lists or input fields
# Generic relationship keywords
```

**Files to Modify**: `modules/constants.py` - add relationship keywords

---

### 1.6 Referral Source Field Detection
**Impact**: Low (1-2 fields per form)
**Complexity**: Low
**Requirement Compliance**: ✅ COMPLIANT

**Description**: Capture "How did you hear about us" / referral source fields.

**Current Issue**:
- "I was referred by:" not always captured
- "How did you hear about us?" missed occasionally
- Referral source checkboxes not consistently detected

**Proposed Fix**:
1. Add referral patterns: "referred by", "hear about", "referral source"
2. Detect associated checkbox lists or text inputs
3. Generic marketing/referral keywords

**Implementation**:
```python
# Patterns: "referred", "hear about", "referred by", "referral source"
# Standard field detection logic
```

**Files to Modify**: `core.py` - field label detection

---

### 1.7 Improved Date Field Detection
**Impact**: Low-Medium (2-5 fields per form)
**Complexity**: Low
**Requirement Compliance**: ✅ COMPLIANT

**Description**: Better capture all date fields including edge cases.

**Current Issue**:
- Some "Date of Birth" variants missed
- Date fields without "Date" keyword not detected
- MM/DD/YYYY patterns without label sometimes skipped

**Proposed Fix**:
1. Enhanced date pattern detection: "____/____/____", "MM/DD/YYYY"
2. Better DOB variant matching: "DOB", "D.O.B.", "Date of Birth"
3. Date fields with underscores but no explicit "date" label

**Implementation**:
```python
# Patterns: date keywords + underscore/slash patterns
# Infer date type from format (____/____)
# Generic date field indicators
```

**Files to Modify**: `core.py` - date field detection

---

### 1.8 Section-Specific Context Enhancement
**Impact**: Medium (improves field categorization, not count)
**Complexity**: Medium
**Requirement Compliance**: ✅ COMPLIANT

**Description**: Better section inference using contextual clues.

**Current Issue**:
- Some fields in wrong sections (though this doesn't affect count)
- Section transitions not always detected
- "General" section still has some miscategorized fields

**Proposed Fix**:
1. Enhanced section heading detection
2. Better keyword-based section inference (already improved, but can refine)
3. Context-aware section assignment based on surrounding fields

**Implementation**:
```python
# Improved section heading patterns
# Better keyword weighting
# Context-based section inference
```

**Files to Modify**: `core.py` - section inference logic

---

## Category 2: Advanced Generic Techniques (✅ COMPLIANT, but High Complexity)

These remain compliant but require significant engineering effort.

### 2.1 Machine Learning-Based Field Detection
**Impact**: High (10-20 fields per form)
**Complexity**: Very High
**Requirement Compliance**: ✅ COMPLIANT (if trained on generic patterns)

**Description**: Use ML to detect ambiguous field patterns.

**Proposed Approach**:
1. Train classifier on labeled form data (multiple forms, not specific to one)
2. Features: text patterns, spacing, font, position, context
3. Predict field boundaries and types
4. Use as fallback when rule-based detection uncertain

**Implementation Effort**: 2-4 weeks
**Maintenance**: Requires model updates, more complex deployment

---

### 2.2 OCR Post-Processing Enhancement
**Impact**: Medium (5-10 fields per form)
**Complexity**: High
**Requirement Compliance**: ✅ COMPLIANT

**Description**: Improve text extraction quality from PDFs.

**Current Issue**:
- OCR errors cause pattern matching failures
- Spacing irregularities from poor OCR
- Character recognition issues (l vs 1, O vs 0)

**Proposed Fix**:
1. Enhanced OCR correction algorithms
2. Better whitespace normalization
3. Character confusion disambiguation
4. Alternative OCR engine comparison

**Implementation Effort**: 1-2 weeks

---

### 2.3 Layout Analysis Engine
**Impact**: Medium-High (8-15 fields per form)
**Complexity**: Very High
**Requirement Compliance**: ✅ COMPLIANT

**Description**: Sophisticated layout analysis for field positioning.

**Proposed Approach**:
1. Analyze PDF visual layout (not just text)
2. Detect form elements by visual features:
   - Boxes/rectangles (input fields)
   - Checkbox graphics
   - Line spacing and alignment
3. Combine with text extraction for better accuracy

**Implementation Effort**: 3-4 weeks

---

## Category 3: Semi-Generic Approaches (⚠️ BORDERLINE)

These are technically generic but feel like edge case handling.

### 3.1 Form Layout Type Classification
**Impact**: High (20-30 fields across all forms)
**Complexity**: Medium
**Requirement Compliance**: ⚠️ BORDERLINE - Classifies forms into types

**Description**: Classify forms into layout types and use type-specific parsers.

**Approach**:
1. Detect form type: "Patient Info Heavy", "Grid Heavy", "Text Heavy"
2. Apply type-specific parsing strategies
3. Not form-specific, but type-specific

**Why Borderline**: 
- Uses classification which feels like "soft" hardcoding
- Different logic paths based on detected type
- Could be considered form-type hardcoding vs form-instance hardcoding

**Implementation**:
```python
# Detect form layout type from characteristics
if grid_heavy_form():
    use_aggressive_grid_parser()
elif text_heavy_form():
    use_aggressive_text_field_detection()
```

---

### 3.2 Field Sequence Pattern Learning
**Impact**: Medium (5-15 fields per form)
**Complexity**: High
**Requirement Compliance**: ⚠️ BORDERLINE - Learns patterns from data

**Description**: Learn common field sequences from processed forms.

**Approach**:
1. Track common field sequences: "First Name" → "Last Name" → "DOB"
2. Use learned sequences to predict missing fields
3. When see "First Name" and "DOB", predict "Last Name" between them

**Why Borderline**:
- Uses historical data patterns
- Prediction based on "what usually appears"
- Could miss truly unique form layouts

---

## Category 4: Form-Specific Hardcoding (❌ VIOLATES REQUIREMENTS)

These explicitly violate the no-hardcoding requirement.

### 4.1 Form-Specific Field Mappings
**Impact**: Very High (50-100 fields across all forms)
**Complexity**: Low
**Requirement Compliance**: ❌ VIOLATES - Explicitly hardcodes forms

**Description**: Create mappings for known forms.

**Approach**:
```python
# Form-specific configuration
CHICAGO_FORM_FIELDS = {
    'line_23': 'referred_by',
    'line_24': 'referral_other',
    # ... explicit mappings
}

if detect_form_type() == 'Chicago Dental':
    apply_specific_mappings(CHICAGO_FORM_FIELDS)
```

**Why It Violates**: Explicitly hardcodes form structure.

**Impact**: Would reach 95-100% for known forms, but doesn't generalize.

---

### 4.2 Form Template Library
**Impact**: Very High (Guaranteed 100% for known forms)
**Complexity**: Medium (per form)
**Requirement Compliance**: ❌ VIOLATES - Form-specific templates

**Description**: Maintain library of form templates.

**Approach**:
1. Create template for each known form
2. Match input against templates
3. Use template-specific field extraction

**Why It Violates**: Requires maintaining form-specific templates.

**Scalability**: Doesn't work for new/unknown forms.

---

### 4.3 Manual Field Rules
**Impact**: High (20-40 fields per form)
**Complexity**: Low
**Requirement Compliance**: ❌ VIOLATES - Manual rules per form

**Description**: Add manual rules for problem areas in specific forms.

**Example**:
```python
# Hardcoded rules for specific issues
if 'Chicago' in form_name:
    # Fix specific missing fields
    add_field('referred_by', line=23)
    split_field('emergency_contact', into=['name', 'phone'])
```

**Why It Violates**: Form-name-based logic.

---

### 4.4 Crowd-Sourced Field Corrections
**Impact**: Medium-High (10-30 fields per form)
**Complexity**: Medium
**Requirement Compliance**: ❌ VIOLATES - Form-specific corrections

**Description**: Allow users to mark missed fields, store corrections per form.

**Approach**:
1. User marks missed field in UI
2. Store correction tied to form signature/checksum
3. Auto-apply corrections on future runs of same form

**Why It Violates**: Corrections are form-specific, stored per form.

---

## Category 5: Hybrid Approaches (⚠️ COMPLEX BORDERLINE)

These try to balance generic and specific approaches.

### 5.1 Adaptive Learning with Approval
**Impact**: High (15-25 fields per form over time)
**Complexity**: Very High
**Requirement Compliance**: ⚠️ BORDERLINE - Learns but requires approval

**Description**: System learns patterns but requires human approval.

**Approach**:
1. System proposes new field detection patterns based on misses
2. Human reviews and approves generic patterns
3. Approved patterns added to generic rule set
4. Never stores form-specific rules, only approved generic patterns

**Why Borderline**: Uses form-specific data but extracts generic patterns.

---

### 5.2 Confidence-Based Field Suggestion
**Impact**: Medium (10-15 fields per form)
**Complexity**: High
**Requirement Compliance**: ✅ COMPLIANT - Generic uncertainty handling

**Description**: Mark low-confidence fields for human review.

**Approach**:
1. All fields extracted with confidence score
2. Low confidence fields flagged for review
3. Human confirms or corrects
4. Improves effective accuracy without hardcoding

**Implementation**: Generic confidence scoring based on pattern match strength.
