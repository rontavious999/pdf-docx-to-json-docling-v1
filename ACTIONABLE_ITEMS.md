# Actionable Items for PDF-to-JSON Docling Pipeline

## Overview
This document outlines actionable next steps to further improve the PDF-to-JSON conversion pipeline based on a comprehensive implementation review. These items are prioritized and categorized for clarity.

**Important**: All improvements must maintain the general-purpose, form-agnostic approach. **Do not hardcode any specific forms or form layouts.**

---

## Priority 1: Critical Feature Gaps

### 1.1 Add OCR Support for Scanned/Image-Based PDFs
**Current Limitation**: The pipeline uses PyMuPDF's text extraction, which only works on PDFs with embedded text layers. Scanned forms (images) are not processed.

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Research and evaluate OCR solutions:
  - Tesseract OCR (free, local)
  - PyMuPDF's OCR capabilities
  - Cloud-based options (AWS Textract, Azure OCR) with privacy considerations
- [ ] Implement OCR detection logic:
  - Detect when a PDF has no text layer
  - Automatically fall back to OCR when needed
  - Add optional `--ocr` flag to force OCR mode
- [ ] Update `docling_extract.py` to integrate OCR capability
- [ ] Test with sample scanned forms to validate accuracy
- [ ] Update documentation to explain OCR support and limitations
- [ ] Add OCR dependencies to installation instructions

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Scanned PDFs are automatically detected and processed via OCR
- Text extraction quality is comparable to native text layer extraction
- Users can optionally force OCR mode via command-line flag

---

## Priority 2: Edge Case Handling Improvements

### 2.1 Multi-Field Label Splitting
**Current Limitation**: Fields like "Phone: Mobile    Home    Work" with multiple blanks are captured as a single field instead of three separate fields.

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Design pattern detection for multi-field labels:
  - Detect multiple underscores or blanks after a single label
  - Identify common sub-field keywords (Home/Work/Cell, Mobile/Office, Primary/Secondary)
  - Use spacing analysis to detect distinct blank columns
- [ ] Implement generic splitting logic in `parse_to_questions()`:
  - DO NOT hardcode specific field names
  - Use heuristics: consecutive blanks, keyword patterns, spacing
- [ ] Handle different spacing patterns from PDF vs DOCX extraction
- [ ] Test with various phone, email, and address multi-field patterns
- [ ] Ensure split fields maintain proper keys and sections

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Lines with multiple blanks/underscores after a label are split into separate fields
- Each sub-field has a descriptive key (e.g., `phone_mobile`, `phone_home`, `phone_work`)
- Solution works generically across different field types (phone, email, address)

### 2.2 Multi-Column Grid Column Headers
**Current Limitation**: In checkbox grids, column headers like "Appearance / Function / Habits" are currently dropped instead of being associated with their options.

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Design approach for capturing grid column headers:
  - Detect header row patterns (short words separated by slashes/pipes/spaces)
  - Associate headers with their column positions
  - Link options to their respective header categories
- [ ] Implement one of these strategies:
  - **Option A**: Prefix option names with category (e.g., "Habits - Smoking")
  - **Option B**: Add category as metadata in JSON structure
  - **Option C**: Create nested option groups if Modento schema supports
- [ ] Update `parse_multicolumn_checkbox_grid()` function
- [ ] Test with various grid layouts (2-column, 3-column, 4+ columns)
- [ ] Ensure solution doesn't break existing grid parsing

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Column headers in multi-column grids are captured
- Headers are meaningfully associated with their options
- Existing grid parsing functionality remains intact

### 2.3 Inline Checkbox with Continuation Text
**Current Limitation**: Checkboxes embedded mid-sentence (e.g., "[ ] Yes, send me text alerts") may not be captured as separate fields.

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Enhance inline checkbox detection regex
- [ ] Create pattern for "[ ] Yes/No, [continuation text]" format
- [ ] Extract both the boolean field and the associated description
- [ ] Determine appropriate field type (boolean, radio, or text with default)
- [ ] Test with various inline checkbox patterns
- [ ] Ensure solution doesn't create false positives

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Inline checkboxes with continuation text are recognized as distinct fields
- Boolean preference is captured along with descriptive text
- Pattern matching is generic and doesn't hardcode specific phrases

- [ ] Add progress reporting for batch jobs:
  - Show "Processing X of Y forms..."
  - Display estimated time remaining
  - Report any failures at the end
- [ ] Test with large batches (50+ forms) to validate improvement

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Processing time scales linearly with number of forms
- Parallel processing option is available for large batches
- Progress reporting provides visibility into batch processing

---

## Priority 7: Template Dictionary Enhancements

  - Add extraction metadata (PDF vs DOCX, page count, character count)
  - Include parsing statistics (sections found, grids detected, options parsed)
  - List near-miss template matches with similarity scores
  - Report unmatched fields that might need dictionary entries
- [ ] Add visual debugging option:
  - Generate HTML report showing side-by-side form text and parsed output
  - Highlight matched vs unmatched fields
  - Show confidence scores for template matches
- [ ] Improve error messages:
  - More specific error messages for common issues
  - Suggestions for fixing problems
  - Links to relevant documentation sections
- [ ] Add validation mode:
  - `--validate` flag to check JSON output against Modento schema

## Implementation Guidelines

### General Principles
1. **Never hardcode form-specific logic** - All solutions must work generically
2. **Use configurable patterns** - Regex, keyword lists, and thresholds should be parameterizable
3. **Maintain backward compatibility** - Existing functionality must not break
4. **Test with multiple forms** - Validate changes against diverse form layouts
5. **Document decisions** - Explain the "why" behind implementation choices

### Testing Strategy
- Use the existing sample forms (Chicago, NPF, NPF1) as regression tests
- Add new sample forms representing different edge cases
- Measure field capture accuracy before and after changes
- Ensure no regressions in existing field capture

### Code Style
- Follow existing code conventions (naming, structure, comments)
- Add version tags to fixes (e.g., "Archivev20 Fix 1")
- Update fix documentation files when making changes
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized (<100 lines preferred)

---

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Goals
- **Field Capture Rate**: Maintain >95% accuracy on test forms
- **OCR Support**: Process scanned forms with >90% text extraction accuracy
- **Test Coverage**: Achieve >70% code coverage with unit tests
- **Processing Speed**: Process forms in <5 seconds each (after optimization)

### Qualitative Goals
- **Code Maintainability**: New developers can understand and modify code
- **User Experience**: Clear documentation and helpful error messages
- **Reliability**: Consistent output quality across diverse forms
