# Implementation Summary - Archivev9 Fixes

## Overview

Implemented 3 high-priority fixes identified in the Archivev9 analysis to improve PDF-to-JSON conversion quality for Modento-compliant forms.

---

## Fixes Implemented in v2.10

### ✅ Fix 8: Section Inference
**Function:** `postprocess_infer_sections()`  
**Location:** Lines 2518-2560 in llm_text_to_modento.py  
**Commit:** 4119ad3

**Purpose:** Automatically move medical/dental fields from "General" to proper sections

**Implementation:**
- Analyzes field titles and keys for medical/dental keywords
- Medical keywords: physician, hospital, surgery, medication, illness, allergy, disease, condition
- Dental keywords: tooth, gum, dental, cleaning, cavity, jaw, bite, smile
- Requires 2+ matching keywords for reassignment (conservative approach)
- Preserves fields already in specific sections

**Results:**
- **npf1 form:** Moved 5 fields from "General" to "Medical History" and "Dental History"
- General section reduced from 26 to 21 fields (19% reduction)
- Medical History increased from 9 to 12 fields (33% increase)

**Example:**
```
Before: [General] have_you_had_a_serious_illness_operation_or_hospitalization
After:  [Medical History] have_you_had_a_serious_illness_operation_or_hospitalization
```

### ✅ Fix 6: Duplicate Consolidation
**Function:** `postprocess_consolidate_duplicates()`  
**Location:** Lines 2562-2620 in llm_text_to_modento.py  
**Commit:** 4119ad3

**Purpose:** Remove duplicate DOB, phone, email, address, SSN fields

**Implementation:**
- Tracks common fields that might be duplicated: date_of_birth, phone, email, address, ssn
- Normalizes keys by removing numeric suffixes (_2, _3) and scope markers (__primary, __secondary)
- Keeps instance in most appropriate section (typically Patient Information)
- Removes duplicates while preserving insurance-scoped fields

**Results:**
- **npf form:** 35 → 33 fields (removed 2 duplicates: date_of_birth_2, ssn_2)
- **npf1 form:** 52 → 50 fields (removed 2 duplicates: date_of_birth_2, date_of_birth_3)

**Example:**
```
Before:
  [General] date_of_birth
  [Patient Information] date_of_birth_2
  [Patient Information] date_of_birth_3

After:
  [Patient Information] date_of_birth (consolidated)
```

### ✅ Fix 1 (Enhanced): Medical Condition Consolidation
**Function:** Enhanced `postprocess_consolidate_medical_conditions()`  
**Location:** Lines 2379-2552 in llm_text_to_modento.py  
**Commit:** 4119ad3

**Purpose:** Consolidate individual medical condition checkbox fields into multi-select dropdowns

**Implementation:**
- Extended existing consolidation logic
- Detects individual checkbox/radio fields in Medical History or General sections
- Identifies fields with medical condition keywords (diabetes, cancer, arthritis, etc.)
- Consolidates 5+ individual conditions into single multi-select dropdown
- Works alongside existing malformed field consolidation

**Results:**
- **Chicago form:** Consolidated 73 medical conditions into 1 dropdown
- **npf1 form:** Consolidated 23 medical conditions into 1 dropdown
- Maintains all condition options with proper names and values

**Example:**
```
Before:
  [Medical History] diabetes (checkbox)
  [Medical History] cancer (checkbox)
  [Medical History] arthritis (checkbox)
  ... (20 more individual checkboxes)

After:
  [Medical History] medical_conditions (multi-select dropdown)
    Options: Diabetes, Cancer, Arthritis, ... (23 total)
```

## Key Principles Followed

✅ **No Hard-Coding**
- All fixes use generic keyword matching and pattern detection
- No form-specific logic or hardcoded values
- Works across all dental forms, not just Archivev9 samples

✅ **Conservative Approach**
- Section inference requires 2+ matching keywords
- Consolidation requires 5+ similar fields
- Preserves existing correct categorizations

✅ **Preserve Existing Behavior**
- No regressions in field detection
- All original functionality maintained
- Backward compatible with existing forms

✅ **Reusable Logic**
- Generic implementations that work across diverse form layouts
- Extensible keyword lists for future needs
- Clean separation of concerns

## Debug Logging

When running with `--debug` flag, the fixes provide detailed logging:

```bash
python3 llm_text_to_modento.py --in output --out JSONs --debug
```

**Sample output:**
```
• section_inference -> Medical History :: Have you had a serious illness... (score=3)
• section_inference -> Dental History :: What is your dental health... (score=2)
• duplicate_consolidation -> Removed date_of_birth_2 from Patient Information
• duplicate_consolidation -> Removed duplicate ssn_2 from Dental History
```

## Files Modified

**llm_text_to_modento.py** (v2.9 → v2.10)
- Added `postprocess_infer_sections()` function
- Added `postprocess_consolidate_duplicates()` function
- Enhanced `postprocess_consolidate_medical_conditions()` function
- Updated `process_one()` to call new post-processors
- Updated version and documentation

**Lines changed:** 182 additions, 7 deletions

## Not Yet Implemented

The following fixes from the analysis remain for future implementation if needed:

### Fix 2: Multi-Line Section Header Detection
**Status:** Not implemented  
**Reason:** Edge case affecting ~10% of forms  
**Impact:** Chicago form still has medical questions in "Dental History" section

### Fix 3: Category Header Detection
**Status:** Not implemented  
**Reason:** Affects 1-3 fields per form  
**Impact:** Minor - occasional junk fields from category headers

### Fix 1 (Complete): Multi-Column Checkbox Line Splitting
**Status:** Partially implemented  
**Reason:** Consolidation logic handles most cases  
**Impact:** Current solution works well for most forms

These can be implemented in future iterations based on priority and need.

## Regression Testing

Verified no regressions on Archivev9 forms:
- ✅ Single-checkbox lines still parse correctly
- ✅ Y/N radio buttons still detected
- ✅ "If yes" follow-ups still created
- ✅ Insurance fields with __primary/__secondary still separate
- ✅ Signature fields still unique
- ✅ Business header filtering still works
- ✅ Text artifact handling still works

---

## Usage

The fixes are automatically applied when running the script:

```bash
# Process all forms in the output directory
python3 llm_text_to_modento.py --in output --out JSONs

# With debug logging to see what fixes were applied
python3 llm_text_to_modento.py --in output --out JSONs --debug
```

No configuration changes needed - all fixes work out of the box.
