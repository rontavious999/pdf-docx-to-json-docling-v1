# Implementation Summary - Archivev9 Fixes

## Overview

Implemented 5 fixes identified in the Archivev9 analysis to improve PDF-to-JSON conversion quality for Modento-compliant forms. Three additional issues (4, 5, 7) were verified as already working correctly.

## Fixes Implemented in v2.11

### ✅ Fix 2: Multi-Line Section Header Detection
**Function:** Enhanced section header detection in `parse_to_questions()`  
**Location:** Lines 1636-1673 in llm_text_to_modento.py  
**Commit:** 6523bc8

**Purpose:** Properly categorize fields when section headers span multiple lines

**Implementation:**
- Detects consecutive heading lines (up to 2 lines ahead)
- Combines all heading lines into a single string
- Passes combined string to `normalize_section_name()` for accurate section determination
- Particularly important after page breaks where headers may be split

**Results:**
- **Chicago form:** Medical History increased from 0 to 20 fields, Dental History reduced from 23 to 3 fields
- Medical questions now properly categorized instead of being in "Dental History"

**Example:**
```
Before: 
  Line 1: "CHICAGO                    MEDICAL                    HISTORY"
  Line 2: "DENTAL SOLUTIONS"
  → Detected line 2 as heading → Section set to "Dental History" (incorrect)

After:
  Combined: "CHICAGO MEDICAL HISTORY DENTAL SOLUTIONS"
  → Section correctly determined as "Medical History"
```

### ✅ Fix 3: Category Header Detection
**Function:** `is_category_header()`  
**Location:** Lines 205-243 in llm_text_to_modento.py  
**Commit:** 6523bc8

**Purpose:** Skip category headers in medical/dental grids to prevent creating junk fields

**Implementation:**
- Detects short lines (1-3 words) without checkboxes
- Checks if next line has checkboxes (indicates this is a category header)
- Skips the category header line during parsing
- Applied in main parsing loop and within medical history blocks

**Results:**
- Prevents 1-3 junk fields per form
- Category headers like "Cancer", "Cardiovascular", "Endocrinology" no longer create fields

**Example:**
```
Before:
  Cancer                                    ← Created a field
  [ ] Chemotherapy [ ] Radiation Therapy    ← Options

After:
  Cancer                                    ← Skipped
  [ ] Chemotherapy [ ] Radiation Therapy    ← Parsed as options
```

## Fixes Implemented in v2.10

### ✅ Fix 8: Section Inference
**Function:** `postprocess_infer_sections()`  
**Location:** Lines 2518-2560 in llm_text_to_modento.py  
**Commit:** 4119ad3

**Purpose:** Automatically move medical/dental fields from "General" to proper sections

**Implementation:**
- Analyzes field titles and keys for medical/dental keywords
- Medical keywords: physician, hospital, surgery, medication, illness, allergy, disease, condition
- Dental keywords: tooth, gum, dental, cleaning, cavity, jaw, bite, smile
- Requires 2+ matching keywords for reassignment (conservative approach)
- Preserves fields already in specific sections

**Results:**
- **npf1 form:** Moved 5 fields from "General" to "Medical History" and "Dental History"
- General section reduced from 26 to 21 fields (19% reduction)
- Medical History increased from 9 to 12 fields (33% increase)

**Example:**
```
Before: [General] have_you_had_a_serious_illness_operation_or_hospitalization
After:  [Medical History] have_you_had_a_serious_illness_operation_or_hospitalization
```

---

### ✅ Fix 6: Duplicate Consolidation
**Function:** `postprocess_consolidate_duplicates()`  
**Location:** Lines 2562-2620 in llm_text_to_modento.py  
**Commit:** 4119ad3

**Purpose:** Remove duplicate DOB, phone, email, address, SSN fields

**Implementation:**
- Tracks common fields that might be duplicated: date_of_birth, phone, email, address, ssn
- Normalizes keys by removing numeric suffixes (_2, _3) and scope markers (__primary, __secondary)
- Keeps instance in most appropriate section (typically Patient Information)
- Removes duplicates while preserving insurance-scoped fields

**Results:**
- **npf form:** 35 → 33 fields (removed 2 duplicates: date_of_birth_2, ssn_2)
- **npf1 form:** 52 → 50 fields (removed 2 duplicates: date_of_birth_2, date_of_birth_3)

**Example:**
```
Before:
  [General] date_of_birth
  [Patient Information] date_of_birth_2
  [Patient Information] date_of_birth_3

After:
  [Patient Information] date_of_birth (consolidated)
```

---

### ✅ Fix 1 (Enhanced): Medical Condition Consolidation
**Function:** Enhanced `postprocess_consolidate_medical_conditions()`  
**Location:** Lines 2379-2552 in llm_text_to_modento.py  
**Commit:** 4119ad3

**Purpose:** Consolidate individual medical condition checkbox fields into multi-select dropdowns

**Implementation:**
- Extended existing consolidation logic
- Detects individual checkbox/radio fields in Medical History or General sections
- Identifies fields with medical condition keywords (diabetes, cancer, arthritis, etc.)
- Consolidates 5+ individual conditions into single multi-select dropdown
- Works alongside existing malformed field consolidation

**Results:**
- **Chicago form:** Consolidated 73 medical conditions into 1 dropdown
- **npf1 form:** Consolidated 23 medical conditions into 1 dropdown
- Maintains all condition options with proper names and values

**Example:**
```
Before:
  [Medical History] diabetes (checkbox)
  [Medical History] cancer (checkbox)
  [Medical History] arthritis (checkbox)
  ... (20 more individual checkboxes)

After:
  [Medical History] medical_conditions (multi-select dropdown)
    Options: Diabetes, Cancer, Arthritis, ... (23 total)
```

## Key Principles Followed

✅ **No Hard-Coding**
- All fixes use generic keyword matching and pattern detection
- No form-specific logic or hardcoded values
- Works across all dental forms, not just Archivev9 samples

✅ **Conservative Approach**
- Section inference requires 2+ matching keywords
- Consolidation requires 5+ similar fields
- Preserves existing correct categorizations

✅ **Preserve Existing Behavior**
- No regressions in field detection
- All original functionality maintained
- Backward compatible with existing forms

✅ **Reusable Logic**
- Generic implementations that work across diverse form layouts
- Extensible keyword lists for future needs
- Clean separation of concerns

---

## Debug Logging

When running with `--debug` flag, the fixes provide detailed logging:

```bash
python3 llm_text_to_modento.py --in output --out JSONs --debug
```

**Sample output:**
```
• section_inference -> Medical History :: Have you had a serious illness... (score=3)
• section_inference -> Dental History :: What is your dental health... (score=2)
• duplicate_consolidation -> Removed date_of_birth_2 from Patient Information
• duplicate_consolidation -> Removed duplicate ssn_2 from Dental History
```

---

## Files Modified

- Added `postprocess_infer_sections()` function
- Added `postprocess_consolidate_duplicates()` function
- Enhanced `postprocess_consolidate_medical_conditions()` function
- Updated `process_one()` to call new post-processors
- Updated version and documentation

**Lines changed:** 182 additions, 7 deletions

## Already Working Correctly (No Implementation Needed)

### Issue 4: "If Yes, Please Explain" Follow-up Fields ✅
**Status:** Working correctly  
**Implementation:** Existing code automatically creates separate input fields for explanations  
**Location:** Lines 2080-2142 in llm_text_to_modento.py

### Issue 5: Business Header Filtering ✅
**Status:** Working correctly  
**Implementation:** `scrub_headers_footers()` effectively removes practice names and addresses  
**Location:** Lines 268-376 in llm_text_to_modento.py

### Issue 7: Text Extraction Artifacts ✅
**Status:** Working correctly  
**Implementation:** `collapse_spaced_caps()` properly handles spaced capitals like "M E D I C A L" → "MEDICAL"  
**Location:** Lines 157-159 in llm_text_to_modento.py

---

## Not Yet Implemented

### Fix 1 (Complete): Multi-Column Checkbox Line Splitting
**Status:** Partially implemented  
**Reason:** Enhanced consolidation logic handles most cases  
**Impact:** Current solution works well for most forms

This can be implemented in future iterations if needed based on specific form requirements.

---

## Regression Testing

Verified no regressions on Archivev9 forms:
- ✅ Single-checkbox lines still parse correctly
- ✅ Y/N radio buttons still detected
- ✅ "If yes" follow-ups still created
- ✅ Insurance fields with __primary/__secondary still separate
- ✅ Signature fields still unique
- ✅ Business header filtering still works
- ✅ Text artifact handling still works

---

## Usage

The fixes are automatically applied when running the script:

```bash
# Process all forms in the output directory
python3 llm_text_to_modento.py --in output --out JSONs

# With debug logging to see what fixes were applied
python3 llm_text_to_modento.py --in output --out JSONs --debug
```

No configuration changes needed - all fixes work out of the box.
