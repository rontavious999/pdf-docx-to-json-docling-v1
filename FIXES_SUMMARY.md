# Quick Reference: Proposed Fixes for PDF-to-JSON Conversion

**Based on analysis of Archivev9.zip containing 3 dental forms**

---

## ðŸ”´ High Priority Fixes (Must Implement)

### Fix 1: Multi-Column Medical Condition Grids
**Problem:** Medical conditions in grid format (3-5 columns) are being parsed as concatenated fields.

**Current Output:**
```json
{
  "title": "Radiation Therapy Jaundice Jaw Joint Pain Respiratory Problems",
  "options": [
    {"name": "Radiation Therapy"},
    {"name": "Jaundice"},
    {"name": "Jaw Joint Pain"}
  ]
}
```
Creates 8-10 separate dropdowns with mangled titles.

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "title": "Do you have or have you had any of the following medical conditions?",
  "control": {
    "multi": true,
    "options": [
      {"name": "Radiation Therapy"},
      {"name": "Jaundice"},
      {"name": "Jaw Joint Pain"},
      ... (70+ individual conditions)
    ]
  }
}
```
One consolidated dropdown with clean option names.

**Solution:**
- Detect lines with 3+ checkboxes (multi-column layout)
- Split into individual checkbox+text pairs BEFORE creating fields
- Consolidate into single medical conditions dropdown

**Files to Modify:**
- `preprocess_lines()` - Add line splitting logic
- `parse_to_questions()` - Improve checkbox extraction regex

**Impact:** Reduces 8-10 malformed fields to 1 clean field per form

---

### Fix 8: Section Inference from Field Content
**Problem:** Medical/dental questions end up in "General" section.

**Example:**
```
[General] have_you_had_a_serious_illness_operation_or_hospitalization
[General] medical_history_-_please_mark_x_to_your_response
```

**Solution:**
- Add post-processing function `postprocess_infer_sections()`
- Use keyword matching to reassign fields:
  - Medical keywords: physician, hospital, surgery, medication, illness, allergy
  - Dental keywords: tooth, gum, dental, cleaning, cavity, jaw, bite
- Only move fields from "General" if 2+ keywords match

**Files to Modify:**
- Add new function `postprocess_infer_sections()`
- Call in `process_one()` after existing post-processing

**Impact:** Moves 10-15 fields per form to correct sections

---

### Fix 6: Duplicate Field Consolidation
**Problem:** Same field appears multiple times across sections.

**Example:**
- `date_of_birth` appears 3 times
- `insureds_name` appears twice
- Multiple phone/address duplicates

**Solution:**
- Add post-processing function `postprocess_consolidate_duplicates()`
- For common fields (DOB, phone, email, address, SSN):
  - Detect all instances
  - Keep the one in the preferred section (Patient Information)
  - Remove others

**Files to Modify:**
- Add new function `postprocess_consolidate_duplicates()`
- Call in `process_one()` after template application

**Impact:** Reduces 3-5 duplicate fields per form

---

## ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority Fixes (Nice to Have)

### Fix 3: Category Header Detection in Grids
**Problem:** Category headers like "Cancer", "Cardiovascular" treated as fields.

**Solution:**
- Detect short lines without checkboxes followed by lines with checkboxes
- Skip category headers during parsing
- Don't create fields for them

**Impact:** Prevents 1-3 junk fields per form

---

### Fix 2: Multi-Line Section Headers After Page Breaks
**Problem:** Headers split across 2 lines after page breaks cause misclassification.

**Example:**
```
<<<
CHICAGO                    MEDICAL                    HISTORY
DENTAL SOLUTIONS
```
Second line ("DENTAL SOLUTIONS") overrides section to "Dental History"

**Solution:**
- Track page breaks (`<<<` marker)
- Aggregate 2-3 consecutive header lines after page break
- Combine before calling `normalize_section_name()`

**Impact:** Fixes section classification in ~10% of forms

## âœ… Already Working Correctly (No Fix Needed)

### Issue 4: "If Yes, Please Explain" Follow-ups âœ…
Current implementation correctly creates separate input fields for explanations.

### Issue 5: Business Header Filtering âœ…
`scrub_headers_footers()` effectively removes practice names and addresses.

### Issue 7: Text Extraction Artifacts âœ…
`collapse_spaced_caps()` properly handles "M E D I C A L" â†’ "MEDICAL"

---

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes
1. **Fix 1** (Multi-Column Checkboxes) - 2-3 hours
   - Most complex but highest impact
   - Test extensively to avoid breaking single-column checkboxes

2. **Fix 8** (Section Inference) - 1 hour
   - Simple keyword matching
   - Low risk, high value

3. **Fix 6** (Duplicate Consolidation) - 1 hour
   - Straightforward list filtering
   - Low risk

### Phase 2: Quality Improvements
4. **Fix 3** (Category Headers) - 1-2 hours
5. **Fix 2** (Multi-Line Headers) - 1-2 hours

**Total Estimated Time:** 6-9 hours for all fixes

## Testing Checklist

### After Each Fix
- [ ] Run on all 3 Archivev9 forms
- [ ] Compare field counts (before vs after)
- [ ] Verify section distributions
- [ ] Check dropdown option quality
- [ ] Ensure no regressions in working features

### Success Metrics

**Fix 1:**
- Medical condition dropdowns: 8-10 â†’ 1-2 per form
- Option names: Clean individual conditions (not concatenated)

**Fix 8:**
- Fields in "General": 20 â†’ 10 (50% reduction)
- Medical History section: Properly populated

**Fix 6:**
- Duplicate fields: 3-5 â†’ 0 per form
- Common fields in "Patient Information" section

---

## Key Principles

âœ… **Generic solutions only** - No form-specific hard-coding  
âœ… **Preserve working behavior** - Don't break existing correct parsing  
âœ… **Add debug logging** - Track all transformations  
âœ… **Test incrementally** - One fix at a time with verification

## Code Location Reference

**Main Parsing:**
- `llm_text_to_modento.py` lines 1624-2197: `parse_to_questions()`
- Lines 430-500: `preprocess_lines()` and related functions

**Post-Processing:**
- Lines 2296-2529: Existing post-processing functions
- Add new functions here: `postprocess_infer_sections()`, `postprocess_consolidate_duplicates()`

**Main Entry:**
- Lines 2580-2600: `process_one()` - where to call new post-processors

## Next Steps

1. Read full analysis in `ANALYSIS_ARCHIVEV9.md`
2. Review code examples for each fix
3. Implement fixes in priority order
4. Test on Archivev9 forms after each fix
5. Verify no regressions on other forms
