# Evaluation Patches Implementation

This document describes the patches implemented based on the feedback in "Evaluation of PDF-DocX to JSON (Docling) Pipeline v1.pdf".

## Overview

The evaluation document provided overwhelmingly positive feedback on the pipeline's accuracy (95%+ field capture), robustness to different form layouts, performance, resource usage, and test coverage. It suggested three specific patches to further enhance the system's reliability and production readiness.

## Patch Status

### ✅ Patch 1: Non-atomic file naming fix
**Status:** Already implemented (no changes needed)

The `unique_txt_path()` function in `docling_extract.py` already handles this issue by:
- Generating unique output filenames using folder hashes
- Preventing race conditions when multiple files have the same base name
- Supporting parallel processing without file naming conflicts

**Location:** Lines 253-286 in `docling_extract.py`

### ✅ Patch 2: Field Key Validation
**Status:** Newly implemented

**Problem:** While the slugify function generates valid keys, there was no explicit validation to ensure all field keys conform to Modento's expected format.

**Solution:** Added validation to ensure all JSON field keys conform to Modento format:
- Keys must be snake_case (lowercase letters, digits, underscores only)
- Keys cannot start with a digit
- Keys cannot contain uppercase letters, hyphens, or special characters
- Keys cannot be empty

**Implementation:**
1. Added `is_valid_modento_key()` function (lines 3127-3166 in `docling_text_to_modento/core.py`)
2. Enhanced `validate_form()` to check all field keys (line 3121)
3. Invalid keys are reported as validation warnings during conversion

**Benefits:**
- Early detection of invalid keys before they cause issues downstream
- Clear error messages when keys don't meet format requirements
- Prevents integration problems with Modento system
- No changes to slugify logic needed (it already produces valid keys)

**Testing:**
- Added 7 unit tests covering valid and invalid key formats
- Tests verify both the validation function and integration with validate_form()
- All tests pass successfully

**Example validation:**
```python
# Valid keys
is_valid_modento_key("patient_name")        # True
is_valid_modento_key("date_of_birth")       # True
is_valid_modento_key("phone_1")             # True

# Invalid keys (would be caught by validation)
is_valid_modento_key("Patient_Name")        # False (uppercase)
is_valid_modento_key("patient-name")        # False (hyphen)
is_valid_modento_key("123_start")           # False (starts with digit)
```

### ✅ Patch 3: Skip Non-Extractable Files
**Status:** Newly implemented

**Problem:** When a PDF has no text layer and OCR is not available, the extractor writes a placeholder text file containing an error message. The pipeline then attempts to convert this file, resulting in an empty or meaningless JSON output.

**Solution:** Gracefully handle files that cannot be extracted:
1. In extraction stage (`docling_extract.py`):
   - Detect when extraction returns error markers (`[NO TEXT LAYER]` or `[OCR NOT AVAILABLE]`)
   - Skip writing the .txt file entirely
   - Log clear warning message with installation instructions

2. In conversion stage (`docling_text_to_modento/core.py`):
   - Check if text file contains extraction error markers
   - Skip JSON generation for these files
   - Return None to indicate the file was skipped

**Implementation:**
- Updated `process_one()` in `docling_extract.py` (lines 313-316)
- Updated `process_one()` in `docling_text_to_modento/core.py` (lines 4080-4083)

**Benefits:**
- Prevents creation of empty or meaningless JSON outputs
- Provides clear user feedback about unextractable files
- Fails fast and loud for files that truly cannot be processed
- User can see warning and install OCR or handle file separately
- Ensures every JSON corresponds to a successfully processed form

**Testing:**
- Added 4 unit tests covering skip behavior and normal processing
- Tests verify files with error markers are skipped at both stages
- Tests verify normal files are still processed correctly
- All tests pass successfully

**Example behavior:**
```bash
# When processing a scanned PDF without OCR installed:
[+] scanned_form.pdf
[!] Skipping scanned_form.pdf – no text and OCR unavailable
    Install OCR: pip install pytesseract pillow && sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr

# Result: No .txt file created, no JSON generated
# User sees clear message about what's needed
```

## Test Coverage

All patches are backed by comprehensive automated tests:

### Test Statistics
- **Total tests:** 93 (82 existing + 11 new)
- **All tests passing:** ✅
- **New test file:** `tests/test_patches.py`

### New Tests Added
1. **Patch 2 Tests (7 tests):**
   - `test_valid_keys` - Verify properly formatted keys pass validation
   - `test_invalid_uppercase` - Keys with uppercase letters fail
   - `test_invalid_hyphens` - Keys with hyphens fail
   - `test_invalid_special_chars` - Keys with special characters fail
   - `test_invalid_starts_with_digit` - Keys starting with digit fail
   - `test_invalid_empty` - Empty keys fail
   - `test_validate_form_catches_invalid_keys` - Integration test

2. **Patch 3 Tests (4 tests):**
   - `test_skip_no_text_layer_marker` - Verify marker detection
   - `test_skip_ocr_not_available_marker` - Verify OCR marker detection
   - `test_process_one_skips_unextractable_text` - Skip in conversion
   - `test_process_one_handles_normal_text` - Normal files still work

## Validation Results

### End-to-End Testing
Tested the full pipeline with sample documents:
```bash
# Extraction
python3 docling_extract.py --in tests/fixtures --out /tmp/test_output
# Result: Successfully extracted 2 files

# Conversion  
python3 docling_text_to_modento.py --in /tmp/test_output --out /tmp/test_jsons
# Result: Generated valid JSON with all keys in snake_case format

# Validation
✓ All keys are valid (snake_case format)
✓ No invalid keys detected
✓ JSON files generated successfully
```

### Key Format Verification
Verified all generated keys conform to Modento format:
- `first_name` ✅
- `date_of_birth` ✅
- `phone` ✅
- `email` ✅
- `diabetes` ✅
- `heart_disease` ✅
- `high_blood_pressure` ✅
- `i_consent_to_treatment` ✅
- `signature` ✅
- `todays_date` ✅

### Skip Behavior Verification
Tested with simulated unextractable file:
```
[skip] unextractable file: scanned_no_ocr.txt (no text layer and OCR unavailable)
✓ File was correctly skipped (returned None)
✓ No JSON output created for unextractable file
```

## Impact Assessment

### Code Changes
- **Files modified:** 2 (`docling_extract.py`, `docling_text_to_modento/core.py`)
- **Files added:** 1 (`tests/test_patches.py`)
- **Lines added:** ~280 (including tests and documentation)
- **Lines modified:** ~20

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ All existing tests continue to pass
- ✅ No breaking changes to API or CLI
- ✅ Existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Changes are additive (validation and skipping)

### Performance Impact
- ✅ Negligible - only adds simple string checks
- ✅ Validation only runs on parsed questions (already in memory)
- ✅ Skip checks are early-return optimizations (faster for unextractable files)

## Conclusion

All three patches from the evaluation have been successfully addressed:

1. **Patch 1** was already implemented - no action needed
2. **Patch 2** (Field Key Validation) - ✅ Implemented and tested
3. **Patch 3** (Skip Non-Extractable Files) - ✅ Implemented and tested

These patches enhance the pipeline's production readiness without compromising its form-agnostic design. The changes are minimal, well-tested, and maintain full backward compatibility. The system now provides better error handling, clearer user feedback, and stronger guarantees about output quality.
