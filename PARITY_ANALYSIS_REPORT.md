RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 100% PARITY:
========================================================================================================================

1. IMPROVE DICTIONARY MATCHING (Top Priority)
   - Forms with <70% dictionary reuse need template expansion
   - Add more aliases and fuzzy matching patterns
   - Review unmatched fields and add to dictionary
   
2. ENHANCE FIELD DETECTION
   - Improve checkbox extraction for complex grids
   - Better multi-field label splitting
   - Detect inline checkboxes more reliably
   
3. ADD MISSING KEY FIELDS
   - Ensure signature fields are always captured
   - Detect and capture date fields consistently
   - Always include patient name/identifier
   
4. CONTEXT-AWARE PARSING
   - Use section headers to improve field classification
   - Better detection of consent text vs data fields
   - Improve handling of nested/composite fields
   
5. FORM-SPECIFIC TUNING (if needed)
   - For forms with <50% parity, may need custom patterns
   - Document any form-specific quirks
   - Add validation rules for known form types
